MITRE ATT&CK Mapping

Tactic: Discovery
Technique: [T1046] Network Service Scanning
- Devices were observed making over 100 connection attempts to a wide range of internal and external IPs.
- The pattern of activity strongly suggested port enumeration across the 10.0.0.0/16 subnet.

Tactic: Execution
Technique: [T1059] Command and Scripting Interpreter
- PowerShell (powershell.exe) was used to execute portscan.ps1.
- Command-line scripts were run via cmd.exe.
- All activity was initiated by the SYSTEM account without interactive user involvement.

Tactic: Privilege Escalation / Abuse
Technique: [T1078] Valid Accounts
- Scripts ran with SYSTEM-level privileges, indicating the use of scheduled tasks or service abuse.

Tactic: Defense Evasion
Technique: [T1036] Masquerading
- The PowerShell and CMD-based scripts were named and located to blend in with legitimate system files (e.g., placed in ProgramData).

Findings
- felix-win10 was one of several devices exhibiting scanning behavior.
- The suspicious behavior was tied to the execution of portscan.ps1 and additional CMD scripts.
- No interactive users were associated with the activity; all executions occurred under SYSTEM.
- Similar scanning was observed on other endpoints during the same period.

Recommendations
- Isolate Affected Systems Immediately
- Perform Full Malware Scans
- Restore from a Known Good Backup
- Audit Scheduled Tasks and Startup Items
- Apply Application Controls
- Set Port Scan Alerts

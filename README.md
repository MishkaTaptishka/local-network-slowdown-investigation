## üß™ Lab Scenario Summary

This lab takes place in a simulated enterprise network environment where **internal traffic is unrestricted**, and tools like PowerShell are **not governed by any execution policy restrictions**.

The **Server Operations team** has reported **degraded performance** on aging infrastructure within the `10.0.0.0/16` subnet. After ruling out **external DDoS or upstream provider issues**, the **Security Operations Center (SOC)** has been tasked with investigating internal traffic patterns for signs of misconfiguration, malicious activity, or resource exhaustion.

As the analyst, your goal is to **identify the root cause** of this internal performance issue by analyzing logs, correlating network and process activity, and building a timeline of suspicious behavior.
